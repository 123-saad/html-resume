    <h2>Mechanical Engineering Resume</h2>
    <hr />

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of
    XYZ, driven by a passion for innovation and problem-solving
    in the engineering field. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid
    foundation in mechanical design, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and
    materials science, complemented by hands-on experience in CAD software,
    simulation tools, and manufacturing processes.</p>

    <p>I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a dynamic engineering
    environment where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to
    grow professionally</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>XYZ 4.0</h3>
    <p>May 2023 - September 2023</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Created a digital twin of a briefcase training-kit assembly using
        Visual Components - A 3D manufacturing simulation software.</li>
        <li>Assisted in 3D modelling the briefcase in SolidWorks and used python
        scripting to model custom behaviours of the briefcase components in
        Visual Components.</li>
        <li>Utilised Node-RED to create an OPC UA server, to allow for
        communication between the PLC of the physical briefcase, and the digital
        briefcase ensuring both are in sync.</li>
        <li>Implemented python scripts to track the part count and cycle time of
        components through both briefcases.</li>
        <br />
        <li> Connected a robotic arm (Fanuc CRX-25iA) to its digital counterpart
        in Visual Components, via OPC UA, allowing for the digital arm to
        imitate the actual arm in real-time.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Utilised Visual Components to create the entire production line
        layout of the ABC - A partner of the XYZ 4.0 which specialises in
        manufacturing 3D printed drones.</li>
        <li>Added behaviours to all the 3D models of the machines and
        experimented with replacing human workers with AGVs amongst other
        changes, to test for optimisation of the production time of the
        drones.</li>
        <li>Generated a realistic video render of the entire process, (from 3D
        printing, up to delivery), with the aid of Blender.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with my supervisor to create a step-by-step
        documentation of all the projects carried out during the
        internship.</li>
    </ul></p>
